      <h2>3- Communication skills.</h2>
      <p>In sports, a team with poor communication doesn’t get far in a championship or end up in a high position in a league. Communication is the essence of sports and the same goes to everything in life. 
        Good communication is a mandatory skill to have if you want to get anywhere in life, and sports teach how to be a good communicator. 
        For example, A team has different individuals, and sometimes with these differences, disagreements will rise up, but since you are an athlete, great communication is one of your traits. </p>

      <h2>4- Ability to receive and make constructive criticism.</h2>

      <p>Sports is all about practicing and becoming a better player. To do that, you will usually ask others If you are doing a technique incorrectly or if you need to work on your stance, 
        and you will give out advice to others too. Not only it will humble you and make you more communicating. It also makes you keen on getting better at whatever you are doing, which is very important for success.</p>
